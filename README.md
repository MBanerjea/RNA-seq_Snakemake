# RNA-seq_Snakemake
An RNA sequencing analysis pipeline from raw reads to counts file, automated through Snakemake.

The repository primarily contains the script file. The sample number is 2. Hence Deseq2 and further downstream analyses are not possible.

The repository will be updated at a later time to reflect actual data and the complete pipeline including Deseq2 and successive steps.
